Looking to buy your next plant? But what about sustainability?
If you are like me and constantly think about more sustainable ways to shop, then, I’d like to introduce you to the new way to shop plants sustainably. The Stem is a new kind of online garden centre that keeps the planet in mind at every step of the process. They are based in London, UK, so if you are not in the UK, check if you have a sustainable option to source your plants from. If there are none, that’s a new business idea right in front of you!

With The Stem, a tree is planted for every order made, and as in mid-2020 they have financed the planting of 5000 trees. I have to make a small digression here to tell you how much of a fan of tree-planting I am. Trees have a real positive impact both on the environment and society, and I recommend everyone to contribute to tree-planting if they can. I keep a personal count of the trees that I directly contributed to plant via various means (volunteering in my city, Ecosia searches, direct donation, tree-bracelet purchase, etc.) and I’m currently at 898 trees planted. Try to beat that!

Now back to The Stem: they are using 100% electric vans, and they protect your plants in transit in recycled paper to reduce the impact of plastic packaging. Thanks for that, I hate plastic so much!

The brand colours have been selected based on those that can be applied using vegetable ink which is better for the environment. And last but not least, they have thought through even the tiniest details. Every order comes with a thank you card, printed on…. seed paper which, when planted, grows into wildflowers. How cool?

This makes me realise how important it is for businesses to make the transition to a positive impact. The Stem is doing just that and they have a fantastic range of beautiful plants, including the first 4 plants on this list (Monstera deliciosa, Sanseviera, Kentia palms and golden pothos). Have a look by yourself. They also have a banana tree plant, yes!
