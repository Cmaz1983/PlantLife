DATABASE CONNECTION

@ credentials and string in a single
@ file so if the database ever needed
@ to be edited, the connection info
@ only has to be changed here.

mysqli_connect( 
1. database server hostname / IP address
2. database username
3. database user's password
4. name of the database we want to use
);

@ We do this below using the preset credential

@ If we were having issues connecting to the

@ what the issue is, we can output the error

die( $dbconnect->error() );
@ This would kill the script and output a connection
@ error string. However it is unsafe to use 
@ this type of  output all the time
